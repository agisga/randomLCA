Changes in randomLCA version 1.0-2

  o fixed bug that caused some non-dentifiable models to be missed

Changes in randomLCA version 1.0-1

  o improvements to help documentation

  o added check for non-identifiability of model

  o include patterns with zero frequency in fitting if supplied - this increases fitting time but gives the predictions for these patterns

 o fixed errors in examples vignette

Changes in randomLCA version 1.0-0

  o changed default graph to marginal for random effects models

  o removed graphtype of both

Changes in randomLCA version 0.9-0

  o there have been major changes in this version

  o added constload parameter to specify that loadings are constant for each outcome and modified use of blocksize parameter so it now refers only to size of level2 units or repeated outcomes in single level models.

  o reduce stepmax in nlm to reduce chance of not finding true maximum

  o use routine from fastGHQuad for Gauss-Hermite quadrature

  o remove initmodel parameter

  o changed fitting algorithm for both random effects models to use generalised EM algorithm.

  o tidy up namespace requirements.

  o change default method for standard errors with outcome.probs to normal bootstrap with 50 simulations.

  o increased the quadrature points in the calculation of marginal probabilities, just to be safe. This should be converted to use adaptive quadrature.

  o change name of class.probs to post.class.probs to better reflect what it does, and add class.probs function to return overall probability of each class

Changes in randomLCA version 0.8-7

  o moved vignettes to correct folder

  o added imports from lattice and boot to fix error message in check
  
Changes in randomLCA version 0.8-6

Changes in randomLCA version 0.8-5

  o reduced examples execution time

Changes in randomLCA version 0.8-4

  o changed fitting parameters fro examples to fix convergence problem on SPARC machines

Changes in randomLCA version 0.8-3

  o remove patterns when supplied frequencies are zero
  
  o fixed documentation of symptoms dataset
  
Changes in randomLCA version 0.8-2

Changes in randomLCA version 0.8-1

  o simplified code

  o fixed bug which caused stop when using verbose=TRUE
  
  o added parameter to control the number of quasi-Newton steps between each adaptive step, and reduced the default to 5

  o restricted the outcome probabilities using a penalty, to prevent numerical problems
  
Changes in randomLCA version 0.7-5

  o improved output formatting in summary

  o more information in vignette

Changes in randomLCA version 0.7-4

  o fixed problems with import of AIC and BIC

Changes in randomLCA version 0.7-3

  o added bibliography to vignette

  o changes to documentation to improve readability
  
  o added check for valid patterns must be 0 or 1 

Changes in randomLCA version 0.7-2

  o changes to documentation to improve readability

Changes in randomLCA version 0.7-1

  o added simulate method to produce random data from fitted models

  o changed default calculation of standard errors to true
  
  o added bootstrap estimation of confidence intervals for outcome probabilities  

  o removed most of the warnings about generated NaN during fitting  

  o checked for excessive number of adaptive iterations 

Changes in randomLCA version 0.6-2

  o increased speed of fitting for standard latent class models
  
  o added Gender Roles dataset

  o updated vignette to allow for label switching

Changes in randomLCA version 0.6-1

  o added an accessor for outcome probabilities with confidence intervals

  o standard latent class now allows probit (this obviously wont affect the
    outcome probabilities but will change the confidence intervals)

  o allowable quadrature points increased to 190
  
  o changed handling of random seeds for random starting values  

Changes in randomLCA version 0.5-3

  o added marginal outcome probabilities and link to summary

  o added accessors for logLik, AIC, BIC

  o changed log.Lik to logLik

Changes in randomLCA version 0.5-2

  o split summary to have separate print method

  o in summary print names for loadings

Changes in randomLCA version 0.5-1

  o added new example to vignette
  
  o improved summary function

  o increased speed of multilevel models by recode in C
  
  o fixed bug with returned outcoem probabilities in multilevel models  

Changes in randomLCA version 0.3-2

  o changes to vignette to allow running on some systems

Changes in randomLCA version 0.3-1

  o recode of algorithm for single level random effects in C

  o for standard LC always perform Quasi-Newton to guarantee convergence

Changes in randomLCA version 0.2-1

  o fixed bug which could cause very occaisonal crash when outcome
    probabilities approached 0 or 1
    
  o recode of EM algorith for standard LC models in C, so very much faster

Changes in randomLCA version 0.1-4

  o fixed bug in adaptive random by class model fit

  o included vignette for examples

First realease version 0.1-1
