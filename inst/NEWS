Changes in randomLCA version 0.7-1

  o added simulate method to produce random data from fitted models

  o changed default calculation of standard errors to true
  
  o added bootstrap estimation of confidence intervals for outcome probabilities  

  o removed most of the warnings about generated NaN during fitting  

  o checked for excessive number of adaptive iterations 

Changes in randomLCA version 0.6-2

  o increased speed of fitting for standard latent class models
  
  o added Gender Roles dataset

  o updated vignette to allow for label switching

Changes in randomLCA version 0.6-1

  o added an accessor for outcome probabilities with confidence intervals

  o standard latent class now allows probit (this obviously wont affect the
    outcome probabilities but will change the confidence intervals)

  o allowable quadrature points increased to 190
  
  o changed handling of random seeds for random starting values  

Changes in randomLCA version 0.5-3

  o added marginal outcome probabilities and link to summary

  o added accessors for logLik, AIC, BIC

  o changed log.Lik to logLik

Changes in randomLCA version 0.5-2

  o split summary to have separate print method

  o in summary print names for loadings

Changes in randomLCA version 0.5-1

  o added new example to vignette
  
  o improved summary function

  o increased speed of multilevel models by recode in C
  
  o fixed bug with returned outcoem probabilities in multilevel models  

Changes in randomLCA version 0.3-2

  o changes to vignette to allow running on some systems

Changes in randomLCA version 0.3-1

  o recode of algorithm for single level random effects in C

  o for standard LC always perform Quasi-Newton to guarantee convergence

Changes in randomLCA version 0.2-1

  o fixed bug which could cause very occaisonal crash when outcome
    probabilities approached 0 or 1
    
  o recode of EM algorith for standard LC models in C, so very much faster

Changes in randomLCA version 0.1-4

  o fixed bug in adaptive random by class model fit

Changes in randomLCA version 0.1-3

  o made vignette creation faster

Changes in randomLCA version 0.1-2

  o fixed bug where convergence failure wasn't identified for some
    models, resulting in infinite loops
    
  o fixed bug causing outcome probabilities of 0 or 1 not to be plotted
  
  o included vignette for examples

First realease version 0.1-1
