Changes in randomLCA version 0.5-1

  o added new example to vignette
  
  o improved summary function

  o increased speed of multilevel models by recode in C
  
  o fixed bug with returned outcoem probabilities in multilevel models  

Changes in randomLCA version 0.3-2

  o changes to vignette to allow running on some systems

Changes in randomLCA version 0.3-1

  o recode of algorithm for single level random effects in C

  o for standard LC always perform Quasi-Newton to guarantee convergence

Changes in randomLCA version 0.2-1

  o fixed bug which could cause very occaisonal crash when outcome
    probabilities approached 0 or 1
    
  o recode of EM algorith for standard LC models in C, so very much faster

Changes in randomLCA version 0.1-4

  o fixed bug in adaptive random by class model fit

Changes in randomLCA version 0.1-3

  o made vignette creation faster

Changes in randomLCA version 0.1-2

  o fixed bug where convergence failure wasn't identified for some
    models, resulting in infinite loops
    
  o fixed bug causing outcome probabilities of 0 or 1 not to be plotted
  
  o included vignette for examples

First realease version 0.1-1
